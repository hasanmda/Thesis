This code named, "Cell_precipitation_Loop" is a common code for the analysis of precipitation.
Changing the NC Files we can calculate the precipitation for different types of climate models.
Climate models are 
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 2.6
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 4.5
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 8.5
- MOHC-HadGEM
- MPI
There is a function with which, the changing the coordinates, data for 107 cells are extracted.

and then with the code "Merged_data_precipitation", all the data were put in a single csv file.
