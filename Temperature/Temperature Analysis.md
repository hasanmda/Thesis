This code named, "Cell_average_Loop" is a common code for the analysis of temperatures.
Changing the NC Files we can calculate the different 
types of temperature (maximum, minimum and surface) for different types of climate models. there are 
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 2.6
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 4.5
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 8.5
- MOHC-HadGEM
- MPI
There is a function with which, the changing the coordinates, data for 107 cells are extracted.

and then with the code "Merged Data", all the data were put in a single csv file.
