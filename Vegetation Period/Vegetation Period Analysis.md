This code named, "Cell_daily_average_surface_temperature_loop" is a common code for the analysis of vegetation period. Changing the NC Files we can calculate the daily surface temperature for different types of climate models.
The models are 
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 2.6
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 4.5
- ICHEC-EC-EARTH RCP 8.5
- MOHC-HadGEM
- MPI
There is a function with which, the changing the coordinates, data for 107 cells are extracted.

and then with the code "Merged Data_Vegetation Period", all the data were put in a single csv file. Then the average of all cells were calculated. After that, the calculation of the days to reach the temperature, 200 degree celsius as cumulative was performed.
